What is your favorite movie?
It changes but for now it's Wonder Woman.

If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?
Sydney, Australia to attend a venue at the Sydney Opera House.

If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
I would like to have super speed like the Flash and super strength, however, I can settle with
having telekinesis. With Telekinesis I can discretly move objects. This power will come in handy
if I get lazy to grab something across the room or a few inches away from me.
